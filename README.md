This is a system for quickly analyzing systems that need to be attacked/defended by assorted armies. 

WIP. 

Do not commit with any active orders. 

## To Use:

Have ruby 3.1.3 installed. I recommend [rbenv](https://devhints.io/rbenv) for your ruby needs.

Run bundler to install all the needed gems
